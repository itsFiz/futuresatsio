### 1. **Overview**

BTC Retirement Planner is a long-term Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation simulation and planning SaaS platform that helps users visualize, plan, and execute a personalized BTC retirement strategy. The platform enables users to define retirement year targets (e.g., 2055), set DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) schedules, simulate dip buy events, include future injections, and project BTC value growth based on compounding cycles (e.g., halving events). This tool is designed to serve long-term investors, high-income earners, founders, and HODLers planning decades ahead.

✅ Final Push Strategy to Reach 5 BTC
🎯 Goal: Add ~0.73 BTC to your ~4.27 BTC
Option	Timing	Injection (RM)	Est. BTC Price	BTC Gained

✅ You’ll have major income from:

💰 Dividends from Arcadia VC

🧠 CareerRPG monetization (B2B & premium tiers)

🎨 Creatopia Studio or Brozkey expansion
